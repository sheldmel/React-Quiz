1. Write a react function that takes the following input:
rooms = [
    { room_type: "Queen", vacant_rooms: 5, price: 100 },
    { room_type: "Double", vacant_rooms: 3, price: 75 },
    { room_type: "Twin", vacant_rooms: 8, price: 60 }

3. Let's say you have a file with a following structure:
"id,name,value
1,Dan,150
2,Peter,300
3,Mark,400
4,Victor,600"

Write a function in node.js that reads this file and returns the number, which is a sum of all "value" numbers from the file;


4. Refactor the code below.
(do not create functions or constants, code refactor is required only)
 
if (province == 'ONTARIO') {
   rate = ONTARIO_RATE;
   amt = base * ONTARIO_RATE;
   calc = 2 * basis(amt) + extra(amt) * 1.05;
} else if ((province == 'QUEBEC') || (province == 'ALBERTA')) {
   rate = (province == 'QUEBEC') ? QUEBEC_RATE : ALBERTA_RATE;
   amt = base * rate;
   calc = 2 * basis(amt) + extra(amt) * 1.05;
   if (province == 'QUEBEC') {
       points = 2;
   }
} else {
   rate = 1;
   amt = base;
   calc = 2 * basis(amt) + extra(amt) * 1.05;
}


5. Write a small react or react native app that uses this weather api:
https://www.metaweather.com/api/ *
Your app should allow the user to search for a city and see that day's forecast.
Styling is not important, you can use default browser styles.
